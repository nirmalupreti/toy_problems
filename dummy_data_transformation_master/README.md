# Toy Problem: Dummy Data Transformation
A simple data transformation task template to introduce new collaborators to the FDm way of working. This is also used as a way to test potential collaborators along the following dimensions:
- Ability to follow test driven development
- Ability to communicate asynchronously in written form in order to get themselves unblocked

Requirements & expectations from this task are outlined here: https://github.com/fractal-dataminds/toy_problems/issues/2. 
Each collaborator will be assigned a specific issue to work on this task.  

**Basic Setup**
* IDE: PyCharm 
* Default Python Version: Python 3.8 (download from python.org)
* Setup a virtual environment (venv) in PyCharm: 
https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/creating-virtual-environment.html#env-requirements
* Update requirements.txt with any dependencies you may need to install, and then install it in your venv by running: 
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
